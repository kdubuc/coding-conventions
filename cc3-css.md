## General

* Put spaces after : in property declarations.
* Put spaces before { in rule declarations.
* Use hex color codes #000 unless using rgba.
* Use // for comment blocks (instead of /* */).

Example :

````css
.example {
  color: #555;
  border: 1px solid #000;
}
````

## Device-agnostic ans mobile-first

Donâ€™t define your breakpoints according to some device, define your breakpoints when your design breaks.

If your application must be mobile, you MUST think mobile-first. You start from the smallest possible space, and built from there.

## OOCSS

You MUST use the [OOCSS principle](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/category/general/geek/css/oocss-css-geek-general/).

## Pixels vs. Ems / Rems

You SHOULD use Ems / Rems / percents instead of pixels.

## LESS

You SHOULD use a dynamic stylesheet language. [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) is recommended.

## Framework CSS

It's highly recommended to use a framework. [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) is recommended.
